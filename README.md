# screen-off

The idea is when you plug in your phone to charge the screen turns on and it's up to your timeout settings to turn off your screen.

If you have a long timeout setting (from playing Pokemon Go *cough*), you don't want to wait 5 minutes until the screen turns off.

The service runs in the background and will turn off your screen when it detects you've plugged into a charger.
